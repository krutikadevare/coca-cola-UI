# Coca-Cola Prototype

This is a simple webpage that embeds a Figma prototype of a Coca-Cola themed design.  
It is hosted on GitHub Pages so anyone can view it directly in the browser.

# How it works
- The project contains a single `index.html` file.  
- It uses an `<iframe>` to display the Figma prototype.  
- GitHub Pages serves it as a live website.

## Tools
- Figma  
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- GitHub Pages
